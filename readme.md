# Welcome to my FTC Team 48 experience showcase

### My primary responsibility was to program our team's autonomous program

The first 30 seconds of this video show my autonomous program:

## Contributions

### Design

* Brainstormed ideas for drone launcher, arm, and overall robot

* Assisted in evaluating other members' designs and critiquing them

* Coordinated with 3D modelers to make sure that there were no interferences with devices/sensors like encoders

### Assembly

* Fixed major problems with mechanical pieces that would constantly fail

* Taught other members how to choose appropriate screw length and tighten screws properly

* Assembled main chassis and arm

* Handled the majority of wiring and electronics

### Drive Team

* Drive Coach during Interleague Tournament

* Driver or Operator during some of the initial meets

* Coordinates with Drivers/Operators to implement intuitive controls

### Programming

* Assisted other members in solving development environment errors

* Streamlined code uploads by introducing wireless code pushing

* Implemented RoadRunner (a library that helps code autonomous paths) to program better autonomous functionality

* Used MeepMeep (a GUI to view simulated RoadRunner paths) to simulate and create autonomous paths

* Implemented PIDF algorithm for precise control over arm movement

* Introduced other members to Java

* Helped create naming conventions among other tools to better organize our code

* Helped create intuitive controls for drivers

* Assisted with some initial TeleOp development

### Artifical Intelligence

* Trained an object recognition model on over 1000 images using the TensorFlow Object Detection interface

* Implemented code to detect our object using a USB-linked camera

* Worked with experts in the field to imporve our model's accuracy

### Other

* I would take the initiative to take the incomplete robot home the day before meets and work into the early morning in order to bring it to a working state

* I'm currently working on being an FTC lead

* In order to better prepare next year's 9th graders for FTC, I'm hosting a summer workshop to train them in CAD and programming
